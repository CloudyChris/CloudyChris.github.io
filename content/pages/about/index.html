    <h2> Andrei Pufu </h2>
    <br><br>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freshman at the polytechnic university of Bucharest, as a mechanical engineering student. I was always passionate about discovery, and since 8th grade, in general school, I started exploring the world of programming, being inspired by my cousin. I started off with simple thing, namely, actionscript 2, then shifted gears to python and C, alongside with web technologies which I used to earn some money. I spend time learning new things, with every occasion I get, and until now I am fairly happy with the OOP skills I developed as well as software architecture knowledge, networking and encryption, and now, Artificial Intelligence (Tensor Flow). I've got a long way to go, but I am confident that for me, this is my meaning. </p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as trivia goes, I love to do back end, and I find it not necessarily hard, but rather unpleasant to do front end development, which is sort of weird, given my love for digital art and making things look good.</p>
